# READMEGenerator

## Description
The main motivation for creating this project was to make the README writing process easier for developers. This app takes user input using the terminal and generates a formatted README using said input. 

The main problems this app solves include:
* Formatting a linked table of contents 
* Adding badges/notices depending on the license 
* Linking ones Github/email 
* Adding description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines and test instructions

Overall this project taught me specifically how to install packages using node.js, use inquirer in order to obtain user inputted information and also how to format various characteristics using MD. 

## Installation
Node was required to be installed as well as inquirer.
``node install -y
  node install inquirer``

## Usage
``node index.js``
